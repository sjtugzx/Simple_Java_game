Review of my partner's code:

1. The code was clear and easy to understand.
2. The code followed standard style and Java conventions.
3. The code was a bit long-winded and used an excessive number of if-statements.
4. Some of the code did not work as expected.
5. Lacks comments and therefore difficult to understand.
6. Excessively verbose and repititive in places.
