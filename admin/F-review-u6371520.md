Comment for my partener's code: 
1. No comments and very hard to read. 
2. Very efficient and terse conding style.
3. The code was clear and easy to understand.   : WarringStatesGame.java:275
4. Good at using loop. ï¼š WarringStatesGame.java: WarringStatesGame.java:275
4. The code followed standard style and Java conventions.
5. The code was a bit long-winded and used an excessive number of if-statements.
7. Lacks comments and therefore difficult to understand.(no comments)
8. Excessively verbose and repititive in places, for instance in Task 4 could have used array and for loop rather than multiple if statements.
9. Did not remove print statements used for debugging.
10. Good using for datastructure : WarringStatesGame.java:278: datastructre
11. Have some errors. WarringStatesGame.java:from 397 to 406.
