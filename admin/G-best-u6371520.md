I submit the following for assessment as my best class.

I completed the UI all by myself. Maybe some codes are a little bit messt, however, it is easy to understand,
and almost every features had been implemented. Apart from designing the UI, I also programmed the logic for our
game.

I thinke these codes are great:
1. The method creatCard() in game.java (line: 186) is great. In this method I creat a hashmap to link the
    card to the supporters. In this case, the ui is have a good outlooking instead of the boring characters.
2. The method makePlacement(String placement, int numPlayers) in game.java (line: 415) is also brillient.
    In this method, I designed a great UI for our game, and add interesting everhanle methods to make our game
    have a interaction with the user.
3. The method isCardPlacementWellFormed(String cardPlacement) in WarringStatesGame.java (line: 49) is very terse. It is 
   beautiful and clean, apart from that, it is also very efficient.
4. The method isPlacementWellFormed(String placement) in WarringStatesGame.java (line: 83) is very terse. It is 
   beautiful and clean, apart from that, it is also very efficient.

I declare that this is entirely my own work
